## Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor

You will need to come up with a product idea, and write it as a proposal that includes:

my proposal
A project description
    My project is a Admin dashboard which follows users activities and analysis data created by the users. The data includes users info such as age, location, as well as there general user activity on the website. The dashboard will also follow unusual/unsavory behavior from users, with the option to flag them for their misconducts. The website from the user-end offers up 10 day challenges for the users interact with. On the Admin dashboard will provide data regarding the appeal/popularity of the challenges to users.   
Who uses it?
    This dashboard will be used by site Administrators

What outputs do they need?
    Outputs would include users info and their activity on the app
What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
    Input would include searching users by email addresses or by region/age to get a bigger picture
A list of technologies that you plan to use
Postgres, React, D3.js, JWT, React-Router v4
A well-defined and written-out feature list
Notifications for suspicious behaviour (as in one user taking part in five challenges simultaneously)
Using Graphs and Maps to get a better understanding of the users
Track popularity of challenges(as in completion rate of challenges and the user ratings)
Taking challenges off searches, due to tepid response
And Much more

Fork this repository and submit a pull request with your proposal in the following format: <firstname>-<lastname>-q3-proposal.

## Follow Agile Workflow

* The methodologies, tools, and roles you use are up to you.

## Create and deploy a complete fullstack app

Your app should:

### BASE GOAL

* Must be full CRUD for at least one model (i.e. posts/comments/etc)
* Must contain server routes handling full CRUD.
* Must use a front end framework (AngularJS, Angular5, React, Vue, etc.)
* Must use client side routing(ui-router, react-router v4, etc.)
* Must contain parent/child components and pass data/functions down from parent component to child component somewhere
* Must use a state management library (Redux / Vuex / ngRx /etc.)
* If any version of Angular/AngularJS is used, it must contain services.

### STRETCH GOALS

* Use Authentication (Login/Logout)
* Use some significant technology that was not covered in the program. This is not required, though. Examples include:
* Using Ember, Angular 4, AngularJS, Vue, etc. on the front-end instead of Angular 1.6
* Making a native mobile app using a wrapper like ionic framework/React Native/PhoneGap/Cordova etc.
* Making a desktop app with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)/[React Native Desktop](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-desktop) etc.
* Integrating a physical device/sensor/internet of things
* Using Rails, .NET, SailsJS, or some other backend framework for building APIs

#### OTHER REQUIREMENTS

* All of the quality standards from earlier projects are the same as far as clean code, commit messages, READMEs, etc.

<a id="video"></a>

## Make a video highlighting the functionality of your app

* Make a 3-6 minute video explaining your project and demonstrating its features
* Due by Sunday 10/15

<a id="write-up"></a>

## Add all three of these to an online portfolio

* Create a portfolio on the [student portal](http://students.galvanize.com)
* Link to your final deployed site, your video, your repositories, and your write-up
* This will be added to your web development portfolio

## Present your work to the class

* Be prepared to spend ~10 minutes presenting your work to the class.

---

This is a realistic approximation of what developing real products is like. You will have approximately 20-25 hours of class time to work on this. **It will not be enough time to do a good job on this project**. Plan on spending extra time outside of class! This is another Big Deal Week, and you should put maximum effort into making it successful. You can and should use your classmates and your instructors as learning resources, but this should be your own work.
